## 📂 Project Structure

To ensure all internal links and assets function correctly, the repository follows this strict architecture:

* `index.html` - The main navigation interface (The Hub).
* `assets/` - Contains branding and UI elements like `title.png`.
* `Games/` - Directory for standalone game files.
    * `TreeSimulator.html` - Atmospheric 3D fog-harvesting simulation.

## 🎮 Current Simulations

### 🌲 Tree Simulator
An experimental 3D environment built with **Three.js**. 
* **Objective:** Harvest fog-energy from trees to generate capital.
* **Automation:** Purchase worker NPCs to scale production.
* **Progression:** Features a Rebirth system with permanent multipliers.
* **Visuals:** Utilizes `FogExp2` and custom neon shaders for a "cyber-forest" aesthetic.
